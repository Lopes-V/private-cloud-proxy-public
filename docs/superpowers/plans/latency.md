# Latency Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Reduce cold-start retry bursts and promptly release cancelled sessions while exposing exhausted quota.
**Architecture:** Preserve the current HTTPS/WSS bridge. Use its existing authenticated HTTPS control path for readiness and idempotent cancellation.
**Tech Stack:** Node 24.22.1, ws, Python packaging, existing GitHub CI / Render Free.
**Spec:** ../specs/latency-design.md

## Global Constraints

- Preserve authentication, TLS verification, IANA policy and numeric DNS pinning.
- 16 sessions, 32 queued, 16 MiB/session; 128 MiB process, unchanged 128 MiB/month client and 2,000 sessions/day.
- No paid resources, keep-alive to prevent suspension, credential logs or ledger reset.

## Review Focus

- Paused WSS reader: explicit HTTPS cancellation frees the server slot.
- Invalid cancellation/authentication: deny and leave live sessions intact.
- Older/unavailable endpoint: bounded fallback, no permit leak.
- Invalid TLS/large readiness response: reject before opening browser.
- Nearly empty budget: fail before upgrade rather than repeated closed tunnels.

### Task 1: Explicit bounded cancellation

Files: bridge/server.mjs, bridge/client.mjs, bridge/test/cancellation.test.mjs.
Interface: DELETE /tunnel/UUID with Bearer -> 204, or 401/404. Client uses UUID from ready verdict; cleanup <=2 s and holds local permit until completion.
- [x] Write/run red tests for paused-reader cleanup, auth and idempotence.
- [x] Implement active UUID -> finish map, HTTPS cancellation, bounded client cleanup.
- [x] Run cancellation and existing Node suite; confirm no leaks and no TLS bypass.
- [x] Commit after verification with other runtime fixes if needed to keep deployed protocol coherent.

### Task 2: Readiness and actionable quota

Files: bridge/client.mjs, bridge/start.mjs, bridge/server.mjs, bridge/test/readiness.test.mjs.
Interface: proxy.checkRelay() -> validated usage, or fixed failure code; 90 s, 16 KiB maximum, 8 KiB reservation. Server rejects insufficient 8 KiB reserve and reports 128 MiB limit.
- [x] Write/run red readiness tests (delay/auth/cota/TLS/large response), plus nearly exhausted upgrade test.
- [x] Implement one-shot readiness before browser spawn and quota admission alignment.
- [x] Run full Node/Python suites and browser checks; document actual limits.

### Task 3: Publish and measure

Files: docs/PERFORMANCE.md, package, checksums.
- [x] Publish runtime, wait for CI success and confirm Render revision.
- [x] Run low-volume authenticated remote browser/cleanup measurements; record timings and limitations.
- [x] Rebuild/test extracted ZIP and update GitHub artifact without another server restart.

Ruling: inline execution uses the existing clean working branch and prior authorization to publish/deploy. No additional design approval is required because the user explicitly delegated routine development decisions.

Review: fresh read-only reviewer identified an unbounded cancel response body (fixed by destroying response on headers) and queued requests missing the quota latch after acquire (red:7rejections; green:1). Both now have regression tests.

Verification:58 Node tests,27 Python/GOST tests (no skips) and2 local Chromium scripts passed. Fresh read-only review found no remaining material issue after fixes.
